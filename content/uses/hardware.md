This page describes the hardware I currently use.

## Computer
* MacBook Pro 13" M1 - the original and still running fast enough
* Some 12th gen Intel CPU - my gaming rig

## Screens
* Dell U3421WE - nice 34" UWQHD Screen with USB-C dock, power delivery, LAN and USB Ports. Used as a KVM between MacBooks and Gaming rig

## Mobile
* iPhone 13 mini - Still fast enough, although iOS 26 is really annoying. The perfect size for me.
* iPad Mini 7 - The small iPad is the perfect media consumption device or note taking device while on the road. Only the battery could be better

## Smartwatch
* Apple Watch Series 8 - Doing it's job just fine.

## Peripherals

### Keyboard
* Dygma Raise OG with linear pink switches - Either a regular keyboard or an ergonomic split keyboard. I'm using the it split.

### Mouse
I've tried a lot of different input devices over the years to avoid hand injuries.

* Logitech MX Ergo S - A trackball that I've moved with a 3D printed part to be in a more vertical position.
* Logitech Vertical MX - The perfect size for a vertical mouse. Only the rubber coating annoys me a lot, since it doesn't last long enough.
* Logitech MX Master 1 - When it was new, the scroll wheel was fantastic. Unfortunately too small for my hands.
* Logitech G400 - My gaming mouse from 2012. Still working today.
* Apple Touchpad Pro - If I'll need gestures, I'm relying on this device. My MacBooks are almost always in ClamShell mode so I can't use the internal Touchpad.

### Headphones
* Beyerdynamic DT 990 - Beautiful headphones where I can by spare parts. Sounds really great.
* Qdelix 5k DAC - A small Bluetooth/USB-C DAC that's connected to the USB Hub of the Dell screen, so it switches automatically depending on the connected machines.

### Webcam
* Some cheap Full HD 60fps cam bought during Covid

### Microphone
* Beyerdynamic Fox - A nice microphone that's connected via USB-C to the KVM USB switch.

## Network
I've changed from TP-Link Omada to Ubiquit Unifi devices in November 2025. I was so happy with my Unifi UXG-Ultra that I've decided to move everything under one user interface.

Wifi: 4x Unifi U7 Pro
Switch: Unifi USW-Lite-8-PoE and USW Pro Max 16 PoE in the rack
Router: UniFi UXG-Ultra

## NAS
* Synology DS218+ - still going strong. Although it's time will come, since DSM 7.3 is the last version available for this modell.

## Raspberry Pi
I've got several depending on their use cases.
