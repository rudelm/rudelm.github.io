## Introduction
I've recently bought a [Heos HomeCinema](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0113XC3D4) and a [Heos 1](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00Y2AAFAE). The Heos devices are created by Denon and offer a multi room wifi speaker setup, similar to Sonos. Since Sonos did not offer a DTS compatible speakerbar for my TV, I've decided to give the Heos devices a try.

Its absolutely amazing how easy these devices are setup. You install the power and install an Android or iOS App on your phone. You can start the Heos app and can configure a new speaker. The speaker will be configured over a regular stereo audio cable. After this configuration step, the speaker will be available to all devices running the Heos app on your local network.

### The GoPack
Denon currently promotes the [GoPack](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00VY91USW): A battery pack for the Heos 1 and a bluetooth dongle which adds support for bluetooth connections on all Heos devices. However, Denon only sells the bluetooth adapter in combination with the battery pack. Since I don't require the battery pack, I was wondering what kind of bluetooth dongle is required.

### A Bluetooth Dongle
I've searched for a few weeks but finally found on amazon.com a bluetooth dongle which was [used by a fellow Heos user](http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B010NISKFK/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R3KC3A968KG0ZY). At the same time I tried to contact the Denon chat support and they recommended me [this Bluetooth dongle](http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Bluetooth-Adapter-Raspberry-Compatible/dp/B009ZIILLI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1447345075&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=plugable+usb+4.0&psc=1). Regardless which one you'll select, you'll need a bluetooth 4.0 dongle with [BCM20702 chipset](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B007MKMJGO):

Just put the stick into the USB port of the Heos speaker:

You can now press and hold the connect button until the Heos starts to blink green:

The Heos is now in discovery mode and can be easily paired with your bluetooth enabled device. This also works for the Heos HomeCinema soundbar:
