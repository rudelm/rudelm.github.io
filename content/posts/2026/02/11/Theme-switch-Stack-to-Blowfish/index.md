## Introduction
It's 2026. I've wanted something fresh in my blog so I've changed my Hugo theme. Instead of using [Stack](https://stack.jimmycai.com/), I'm now using [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). Blowfish supports out of the box more features I've needed and I was unable to get them right in Stack.

### Some of the features I wanted

#### Better support for subpages
I wanted a dedicated `/uses` page. While in theory possible, I was unable to get it properly displayed. I'm now quite happy with the current result.

#### Mastodon support
This theme supports links to Mastodon without manual interaction.

#### RSS feed support
I can quite easy offer an RSS feed for my page

#### Robots.txt support
I can try to use a `Robots.txt` to get unwanted Bots slurping my blog content of my page.

#### Return to top
When I scroll down a longer post, a link to the top is added. This is configurable.

## Conclusion
I'm quite satisfied with the new theme. I'll probably tune some of the backgrounds etc. later but out of the box it's quite nice.
