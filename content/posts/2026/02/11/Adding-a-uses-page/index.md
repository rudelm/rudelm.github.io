During the end of the year 2025 I've started to think about writing down which tools I've used. I've seen this trend online on some other blogs already and wanted to give it a try. Here's a list of my inspirations:

 * [Jose Munoz](https://www.josemunozmatos.com/blog/added-a-uses-page)
 * [Jan-Lukas Else](https://janlukas.blog/uses/apps)
 * [Daniel Marcinkowski](https://meetdaniel.me/uses/)


The idea is that I'll have a log of tools I've used over the years so I can see what changed and what tools are really useful to me. I still can't decide if I like separete sub pages better or if a single page with all topics is better. This might change when I see some things being too annoying to organize or to update.

You can find my `/uses` page either via the header menu or you can directly open it via [/uses](/uses).
