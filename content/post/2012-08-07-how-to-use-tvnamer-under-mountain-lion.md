A reader asked my in the comments of my blog if I already upgraded to Mountain Lion and if I used [tvnamer](https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/#readme) so far. Just yesterday I realized that tvnamer was not working anymore. You need to reinstall tvnamer with the following command:

    sudo easy_install tvnamer

Eventually you will need to install [Xcode and the command line utilities](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
