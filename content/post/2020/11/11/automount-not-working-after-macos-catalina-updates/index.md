title: automount not working after macOS Catalina updates

---
# Introduction
I've recently upgraded to macOS catalina. My automount mount for music media [was broken]({{< ref"/post/2020/10/26/fix-broken-automount-mounts-on-macos-catalina" >}}). I fixed it and today it is again not working.

## The problem and solution
The last change I did was to install the supplemental update for 10.15.7 which seems to overwrite the /etc/auto\_master so my /etc/auto\_smb wasn't loaded anymore. Here's my current working content:

```
#
# Automounter master map
#
+auto_master		# Use directory service
#/net			-hosts		-nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid
/home			auto_home	-nobrowse,hidefromfinder
/Network/Servers	-fstab
/-			-static
/-			auto_smb	-nosuid,noowners
```

Don't forget to run

```
sudo automount -vc
```

after it you've changed the file. Your automount should now work again.
