title: Update Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 - my experience

As I've written in [my last blog post](http://centurio.net/2015/07/30/how-to-update-to-windows-10-immediately-without-waiting/), I'm one of the guys who likes to test the newest and latest software versions. In this case, Windows 10. So I've updated my gaming system with the tool from Microsoft I've mentioned.

The setup tool of Windows 10 warned me about two things:

  * All your apps will be removed and only your personal data is kept.
  * Your language pack will be removed (english) and will be reset to german.

The first one was really misleading: All apps? What defines an app? Isn't that only the one from the market place? Apparently not, because I've lost all my installed applications as promised. The update wasn't able to reuse the installed applications, which is really sad for an update imho.

The language pack is reset to german: well, that's somehow ok, although I've installed an english Windows 8.1 pro and only enabled the german keyboard layout and date/timezones. I would have assumed that it continues to use english as the system language, but it seems that you need to [install one of the language packs](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-packs#lptabs=win10) again.

This left me only with one possible choice: restore Windows 8.1. Open start, type  "update" and open the update settings. Select  "restore" from the left menu and select  "return to Windows 8.1".

**This option exists only for 31 days after your update** and will ask you for the reasons why you want to restore your system. A few restarts later and your system is thankfully restored to its previous state: All apps are working, your Windows 10 reservation is still active.

**So if you ask me: It's too early to update to Windows 10. At least with this media creation tool which seems to support only the creation of new installations of Windows 10.**
