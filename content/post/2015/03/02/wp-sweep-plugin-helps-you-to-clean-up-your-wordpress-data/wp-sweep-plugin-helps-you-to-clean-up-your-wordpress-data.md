Inspired by this tweet, I've decided to give WP-Sweep a try:

WP-Sweep is a new WordPress plugin which only uses the official WordPress API to delete and clean up orphaned and unused data.

I've given it a try on my personal blog and it worked flawlessly. Unfortunately I've forgot to write down the exact percentages on what could be sweeped and saved but I have now a good feeling that at least my > 3000 blocked spam comments are finally gone ğŸ™‚

Don't forget to backup your data, before you try this!
