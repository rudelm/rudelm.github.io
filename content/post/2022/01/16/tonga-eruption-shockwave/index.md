# Introduction
Yesterday early German time, the [Hunga Tonga volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunga_Tonga) erupted explosively.

This was visible from space and its shockwave caused [tsunami](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60007119) and a measurable peak in air pressure sensors:

I'm hosting an air quality station for the [German Feinstaubsensor network](https://sensor.community/en/), which is equipped with a [Bosch BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) humidity sensor. This chip has also a sensor for the air pressure.
