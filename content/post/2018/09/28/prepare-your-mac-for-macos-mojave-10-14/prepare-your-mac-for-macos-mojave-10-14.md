So Apple release the final version of macOS Mojave aka. 10.14. Before you start your update, you should check, if your important tools are 64bit compatible.

This version of macOS [will annoy you with warnings](https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/05/macos-mojave-32-bit-support/) about your apps being 32bit each time you start them. While you will still be able to execute 32bit apps in Mojave, I used the opportunity to get rid of a few 32bit apps.

How do you check, which apps are still 32bit? You can verify this from the system information app. Click on your Apple symbol in the menu line and select  "About this Mac". Click on  "System Report". Check now Software/Applications. You can filter the list by  "64-bit (Intel)". Each app marked with  "No" should produce the popup.

In my case I had these apps replaced by either updates or different tools:

  * AudioBookBuilder - [version 2.0](http://www.splasmata.com/?p=3236﻿) will be made public or maybe not  - replaced with [AudioBook Binder (Apple App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/audiobook-binder/id413969927?l=en&mt=12) 
  * Caffeine - no Update and no longer being developed - replaced with [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake)
  * iMovie 9 - no Update for this version possible - export all projects and delete, replace with never iMovie version  
    
  * ViMediaManager v0.7α14 - replaced with [MediaElch](https://www.kvibes.de/mediaelch/)
  * DVD player - will get an update [later](https://www.heise.de/mac-and-i/meldung/macOS-Apple-kuendigt-32-Bit-Apps-OpenGL-und-OpenCL-ab-4068653.html)

Be sure to update all your other 64bit apps as well before you start the update.
