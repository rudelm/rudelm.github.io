title: Howto disable Raspberry Pi Status LEDs with RaspberryMatic

# Introduction
I'm using a RaspberryPi 3 with RaspberryMatic distribution to control my HomeMatic thermostats. This distribution has a &#8222;heartbeat" functionality, which leds the green LED of the Pi light up in constant time intervals.

These LEDs are quite strong and disturb the sleep of my family. Therefore its time to [disable these leds](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47186#p473755).

## Disable the leds

Connect via SSH to the RaspberryMatic installation. Edit or create the file /usr/local/etc/rc.local and add this content:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo none >/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
echo none >/sys/class/leds/led1/trigger
```

Now make this script executeable:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.local
```

This script is executed on each start and disables the LEDs completely. No need to use some duct tape to mask the LEDs anymore ðŸ™‚
