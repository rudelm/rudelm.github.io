I recently tried to use my iPhone 4S with iOS 6 to control my iTunes 10.7 on my Macbook Pro. This used to work but the official Apple Remote App did not successfully connect to iTunes anymore.

I followed the [knowledge base article](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1741) and tried to reset all remote settings in iTunes, as well as controlling my wireless network settings. After several unsuccessful tries to pair both machines, I tried to switch my Macbook to LAN connectivity instead of WLAN. And this was the first clue, that the problems must have something to do with my network settings, as I could not pair my iPhone with iTunes anymore.

The key to success was to restart my WLAN router ([AVM Fritz!Box 3270](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0019R47PM)). Devices from AVM are [known for their problems](http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.router-forum.de%2Fboard-avm-fritz%2Fthread-problem-mit-apple-bonjour-ueber-fritz-box-7170-48047-page-1.html&act=url) with Bonjour&#8217;s UDP Multicast packets. They are sometimes blocked when the router is running for too long without reboot. So restarting helped me a lot, because after this I could pair iPhone and iTunes again and could start controlling my Macbook&#8217;s iTunes again ðŸ™‚
